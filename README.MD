# AVR based Midi Controller

This is some test code I am writing for a AVR (Arduino) based MIDI controller for an organ. I am pieceing togeather some code.

Currently the code is feeding a circular queue in the main and using interrupt on the UART port to send out the commands to the MIDI sheild.

I am using AVR Studio 7.0 to compile, I don't think I have the git repo set up nicely, it's just tracking the source.
